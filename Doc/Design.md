# Design
`DecoR8R` informs its users about their environment. It does not try to display all relevant and pertinent information on the command line. Instead, it shares the repsonsibility to inform accross `tmux`, `nvim` and the shell (`zsh`, `bash`, `pwsh` and `fish`).

It is opinionated. It does not try to cover all tools or environements.
